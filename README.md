# LearningVB.NET
As part of my pursuit to continually pursue new knowledge of technologies in the areas of software engineering and computer science, I am currently learning Visual Basic .NET to hone my skill set further with .NET technologies. This will include some rough work, as I teach myself using https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vb.net/index.htm.
Additionally this may include some simple projects as a practice what I have learnt.
